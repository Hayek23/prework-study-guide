# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage is a study guide for my coding bootcamp. It covers HTML, CSS, GIT, and JavaScript. It is so that all of my notes from the prework are in a neat organized place. while creating this I learned all 4 of the resources and languages.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Each section in this webpage contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, GIT, and JavaScript. If we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
